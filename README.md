# TinyLoRaLight
Fork of the Adafruit [TinyLoRa](https://github.com/adafruit/TinyLoRa) library.

# Features

Tries to skim a few bytes and used pins at the expense of no radio status feedback.

As the original, it also works on the plain Arduino UNO. I've also tested it with an ATTiny85 running the [ATTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore).
